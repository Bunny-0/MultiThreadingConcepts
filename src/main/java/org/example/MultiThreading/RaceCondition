A race condition in multithreading occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing
or interleaving of multiple threads accessing shared resources.
It leads to unpredictable and erroneous results because the outcome depends on which thread wins the "race" to
access the shared resource.


To prevent race conditions, synchronization mechanisms like locks or the synchronized Keyword,AtomicInteger and volatile can be used
