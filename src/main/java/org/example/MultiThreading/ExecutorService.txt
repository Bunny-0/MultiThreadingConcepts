JAVA EXECUTOR SERVICE.

> It's a high-level concurrency utility

> that provides a way to manage and execute tasks asynchronously in a pool of threads.

> Executor Service abstracts away the complexity of thread management, making our lives as developers much ea:

> Executor Service provides different implementations catering to various concurrency requirements:

        Single Thread Executor: This Executor Service maintains a single thread for executing tasks sequentially.
        It's useful for tasks that need to be executed in a specific order or when you want to ensure thread safety.

        Fixed Thread Pool: The Fixed Thread Pool Executor Service maintains a fixed number of threads in its pool.
        Once a task is submitted, it's executed by one of the available threads. If all threads are busy,
        the task is queued until a thread becomes available.

        Cached Thread Pool: Unlike the Fixed Thread Pool, the Cached Thread Pool Executor Service dynamically adjusts
        the number of threads based on the workload. If a new task is submitted and no threads are available,
        a new thread is created. Conversely, if a thread remains idle for a certain period, it's terminated and removed from
        ThreadPool.

While Executor Service is more abstract and easier to use,
ThreadPoolExecutor offers greater flexibility and customization ptions.


ExecutorService is commonly used in various real-time applications where multithreading and
asynchronous task execution are essential. Here are a few examples:

-->Web Servers: Web servers often use ExecutorService to handle incoming HTTP requests asynchronously.
Each incoming request can be processed by a separate thread from the thread pool managed by the ExecutorService,
allowing the server to handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently.

-->Database Connection Pooling: Applications that interact with databases can use ExecutorService to manage a pool
of database connection threads. This allows multiple database queries to be executed concurrently without the overhead
of creating and destroying database connections for each query.

-->Real-time Data Processing: Applications that process real-time data streams, such as financial trading platforms
or sensor data processing systems, can benefit from ExecutorService for parallelizing data processing tasks.

By distributing tasks across multiple threads, these applications can achieve higher throughput and responsiveness.
-->Batch Processing: Batch processing applications, such as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines or data analytics
 systems, often use ExecutorService to parallelize the processing of large datasets.
 Each task in the batch can be executed concurrently, utilizing the available processing resources efficiently.

    public static void executeQueryAsync(String query) {
        executorService.execute(() -> {
            try (Connection connection = getConnection()) {
                // Execute database query using the connection
                // Example:
                // PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query);
                // ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery();
                // Process ResultSet or perform other database operations
                System.out.println("Executing query: " + query);
            } catch (SQLException | InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            } finally {
                // Release the connection back to the pool after executing the query
                // This ensures that the connection is available for reuse
                releaseConnection(connection);
            }
        });
